BrainStrain is an online treasure hunt or question-answer puzzle. It is built on PHP, with Facebook Connect as its main feature for user authentication. It also allows feeds to be posted to users' profiles. The code is simple and neat.

Installation:

1. Upload the files to a localhost or web server.
2. Create a database and add the details in lib/user_sessions.php.
3. Create a Facebook app with Facebook authentication and add secret keys to user_session.
4. Run the SQL file to create the tables.

That's all there is to it.
